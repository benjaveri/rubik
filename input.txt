CUBE STATE
===========

you have two options:

1. 26 cubies with colors arranged in groups as below
    colors can be any symbols - typically the 6 face colors and
    you can use a wildcard color for don't care configs

        U
    UFL UF UFR UR UBR UB UBL UL
    FL  F  FR  R  BR  B  BL  L
    DFL DF DFR DR DBR DB DBL DL
        D

2. 6 faces with 3x3 colors in succession, reading top->bottom, 
    left to right when facing you

    UUUUUUUUU FFFFFFFFF RRRRRRRRR BBBBBBBBB LLLLLLLLL DDDDDDDDD



PROBLEM INPUT
==============

problems are specified as text files on command line with instructions as 
  explained below. 
  * note that only the 'pop' command removes cubes from the cube stack

push <cube>
  put given cube config on stack. autodetects 26 cubie or 6 face format

pop
  removes top of stack

(twist|turn) <list of turns whitespace separated and terminated by EOL>
  make given moves on top of stack

print [cubies]
  print top of stack to stdio in faces format unless otherwise specified

dup
  duplicates cube on top of stack

solve <depth>
  start with cube on top of stack and print all the combinations that reaches second to top 
   of stack within <depth> moves

set <parameter> to <value>
  set a config parameter to a specific value
  
  set halfturn <on | off>
    enable half turns (F2, L2, etc)
 
  set medianturn <on | off>
    enable median turns (M, E, S)

  set wideturn <on | off>
    enable double wide turns (Fw, Uw, etc)

  set cuberotation <on | off>
    enable rotation of entire cube (X, Y, Z)

  set xptable <size in MB>
    hash table size for transposition elimination - bigger is better
      but you dont want to spill to disk, so pick a number like 0.5 - 0.75 of RAM

  set threads <number>
    set number of parallel threads to search for solutions


reset
  resets all parameters to their defaults
    halfturn on
    medianturn off
    wideturn off
    cuberotation off
    xptable 1024
    threads (number of physical cores on platform)

end
  terminate program


example program:

push U UFL UF UFR UR UBR UB UBL UL FL F FR R BR B BL L DFL DF DFR DR DBR DB DBL DL D
dup
turn F L
solve 2
end
